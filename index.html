        <h1>I Went to Asia by Myself for Three Months and It Was Nice</h1>
        <p>
            Sometime in May of 2019, I got an email from "Scott's Cheap Flights" letting me know about some (surprise) cheap flights. I was only a couple months into what would become a long and necessary break from working, and I thought "maybe it's time for me to travel." Luckily, Scott had my back, and he pointed me to a round trip ticket from Charlotte to Tokyo for less than $600. Upon further finagaling and opening up a new Delta credit card, I saved another $200. Scott and I made a great team.

            The only thing I had planned was an Airbnb in Tokyo for the first two weeks and a return flight home. I figured out the rest as I went. There was a friend of a friend I wanted to meet up with in Kyoto, some old co-workers and college friends in Korea, 
            and another friend living in Thailand who first met me in Taiwan, so I was grateful to have folks scattered around, and that guided me in deciding where to go. I was happy to stick to countries where I knew people. I also went on a lot of dates. Turns out getting help from people while you travel around a foreign country is SUPER AMAZING.

                    I started in Tokyo. The flight was long and my neck pillow was not the game changer I was hoping it would be. I was completely disoriented and jet-lagged as hell. 
                    I began to see that this trip would be challenging and, for that reason, incredibly rewarding. And it was!

                    The currency in Japan is the yen, which uses the symbol &#165;. Conveniently, I have now satisfied the HTML entity requirement of this assignment by telling you this fact.
